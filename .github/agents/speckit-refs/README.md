# SpecKit Agent References

## Owner
SpecKit (external dependency — reference only)

This directory contains SWAIF-maintained references to SpecKit-owned production agents.
Canonical behavioral definitions and implementation details are owned by SpecKit and must be updated at the source first.

SWAIF uses these references to document invocation triggers, injected parameters, and post-run validation contracts.
