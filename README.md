# SWAIF Documentation Hub

SWAIF (Software Architecture with Intelligent Frameworks) is a specification-driven engineering discipline for delivering high-precision software systems.

This repository is the canonical documentation source for SWAIF.

It contains:
- Governance model (Constitution and Articles)
- Stage-based workflow definition
- Agent roles and execution modes
- Templates (specify, plan, tasks)
- Research methodology and validation framework
- Case study documentation
- Benchmark structure
- Funding and presentation materials

This repository does NOT contain execution cases, experiments, or product implementations.
Hands-on execution lives in separate SWAIF execution repositories.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

- Framework Definition
- Governance Reference
- Research & Validation Blueprint
- Canonical Agent & Template Source
- Documentation Derivation Base (funding, pitch, technical papers)

It is the “engine specification,” not the factory floor.

---

## SWAIF Core Principles

- Specification before implementation
- Constitutional governance
- Stage-gated workflow
- Traceability from requirement to code
- Risk-based execution modes
- Continuous validation

### Key Areas

- Governance – Constitutional model and amendments
- Workflow – Stage definitions and gate criteria
- Agents – Roles and execution modes
- Research – Validation protocol and measurement framework
- Funding – Derivative materials for public investment programs
- Templates – Canonical SDD artifacts
- .specify/ – Reference memory and factory rules

---

## Relationship to Execution Repositories

Execution repositories will:

- Import or sync templates from this repo
- Implement feature cases
- Log experiments and benchmarks
- Generate production artifacts

This repository remains stable and documentation-focused.

---

## Versioning Philosophy

Changes here represent:
- Evolution of SWAIF methodology
- Governance updates
- Workflow refinements
- Research framework adjustments

Execution data must never be stored here.

---

## Contribution Model

Contributions should:

- Improve clarity
- Strengthen governance definitions
- Refine validation methodology
- Maintain structural coherence

Avoid:

- Adding experimental logs
- Adding production code
- Adding prototype artifacts
