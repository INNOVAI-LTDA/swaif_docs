# SWAIF Documentation Hub

## Overview
SWAIF is a lightweight, stage-based delivery framework that helps teams move from idea to production with clear governance, repeatable execution, and continuous learning. This repository centralizes the core guides, handbook material, and reference documents needed to adopt SWAIF in real projects.

## Philosophy
SWAIF is built on a few practical principles:

- **Small, testable increments over large speculative plans**
- **Governance that enables delivery, not bureaucracy**
- **Traceability from constitutional principles to daily work**
- **Feedback loops that improve velocity and reliability over time**

## Quick Navigation
- [SWAIF Handbook](docs/SWAIF_HANDBOOK.md) — Complete framework reference (Parts I–VI)
- [Quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md) — Fast path from prerequisites to first project
- [Constitution Guide](docs/CONSTITUTION_GUIDE.md) — Article-by-article interpretation and amendments
- [Workflow Guide](docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) — Daily operating model, stage transitions, troubleshooting
- [Case Studies](docs/CASE_STUDIES.md) — Applied examples including OAuth2 delivery timeline
- [Comparison Matrix](docs/COMPARISON_MATRIX.md) — SWAIF vs alternatives, with cost/ROI framing
