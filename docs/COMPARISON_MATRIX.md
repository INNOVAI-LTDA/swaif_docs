# Comparison Matrix

This matrix compares SWAIF with common alternatives using operational and economic dimensions.

## SWAIF vs Alternatives

| Dimension | SWAIF | Ad-hoc Delivery | Heavyweight Governance Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Delivery cadence | Stage-based, iterative | Inconsistent, person-dependent | Predictable but slower |
| Governance overhead | Moderate, purpose-built | Low upfront, high downstream correction | High upfront and ongoing |
| Risk visibility | Continuous and explicit | Often reactive | Structured but sometimes delayed |
| Team autonomy | Guided autonomy with clear boundaries | High but uneven quality | Lower autonomy |
| Scalability across teams | High with shared templates | Low to moderate | Moderate |

## Cost / ROI Considerations

| Metric | SWAIF Expectation | Typical Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time-to-first-value | Medium setup, fast subsequent cycles | Faster value realization after initial adoption |
| Defect escape cost | Lower through early validation | Reduced production remediation spend |
| Coordination cost | Reduced via explicit decision rights | Fewer cross-team delays |
| Change failure cost | Lower with staged release checks | Less rollback and incident impact |
| Continuous improvement ROI | High due to structured feedback loops | Compounding process gains over time |

## Interpretation Notes
- SWAIF is optimized for organizations that need both speed and governance.
- Ad-hoc approaches may appear faster initially but often incur hidden rework costs.
- Heavyweight models can improve control but may suppress iteration speed.
