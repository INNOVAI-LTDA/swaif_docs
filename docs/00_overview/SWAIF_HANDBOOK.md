## Part I — Foundations

### Chapter 1: Why SWAIF Exists
SWAIF addresses gaps between strategic intent and executable work by introducing explicit stages, decision gates, and learning loops.

### Chapter 2: Core Principles
The framework emphasizes incremental delivery, transparent governance, measurable outcomes, and retrospective adaptation.

### Chapter 3: Roles and Responsibilities
Clear ownership is assigned across sponsors, product leads, engineering, operations, and governance stewards.

## Part II — Governance

### Chapter 4: Constitutional Layer
The constitution defines non-negotiable operating principles, authority boundaries, and accountability expectations.

### Chapter 5: Decision Rights
Decision rights map choices to roles based on impact radius, urgency, and reversibility.

### Chapter 6: Risk and Compliance Boundaries
Risk thresholds and compliance constraints are documented as design-time inputs, not end-stage surprises.

## Part III — Delivery System

### Chapter 7: Stage Model Overview
SWAIF uses a stage model that makes readiness explicit and prevents hidden work from progressing unchecked.

### Chapter 8: Planning and Intake
Intake evaluates objective, scope, assumptions, dependencies, and success criteria before work starts.

### Chapter 9: Build, Validate, Release
Execution combines development, quality validation, and controlled release as one continuous capability.

## Part IV — Operations

### Chapter 10: Daily Cadence
Teams maintain flow through short syncs, visible blockers, and ownership-driven updates.

### Chapter 11: Observability and Metrics
Operational metrics include lead time, deployment health, defect escape rate, and outcome attainment.

### Chapter 12: Incident Learning
Incidents are handled with blameless response and converted into durable process and system improvements.

## Part V — Organizational Adoption

### Chapter 13: Team Onboarding
New teams adopt SWAIF through a baseline assessment, pilot scope, and coached first cycle.

### Chapter 14: Portfolio Rollout
Portfolio adoption uses phased waves, shared playbooks, and cross-team governance harmonization.

### Chapter 15: Change Management
Change management aligns communication, enablement, and leadership sponsorship with measurable adoption targets.

## Part VI — Continuous Improvement

### Chapter 16: Feedback Architecture
Feedback is collected from delivery telemetry, stakeholder input, and post-release learning.

### Chapter 17: Improvement Backlog
Improvement items are prioritized by systemic impact, implementation effort, and risk reduction potential.

### Chapter 18: Evolving the Framework
SWAIF evolves via controlled updates that preserve constitutional integrity while enabling local adaptation.
