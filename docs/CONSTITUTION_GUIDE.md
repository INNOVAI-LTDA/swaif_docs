# Constitution Guide

This guide explains how to interpret SWAIF constitutional articles and evolve them responsibly.

## Article-by-Article Explanation

### Article I — Purpose and Scope
Defines the mission of SWAIF and the boundaries of where the framework applies.

### Article II — Principles
Codifies non-negotiable values: transparency, accountability, incrementalism, and evidence-based decisions.

### Article III — Authority and Decision Rights
Assigns who can decide what, including escalation paths and emergency exceptions.

### Article IV — Delivery Integrity
Requires stage discipline, quality gates, and explicit acceptance criteria.

### Article V — Risk, Security, and Compliance
Ensures regulated requirements and risk controls are incorporated from planning onward.

### Article VI — Learning and Improvement
Mandates retrospectives, incident learning, and periodic framework updates.

## Amendment Process
1. **Proposal Drafting** — Submit an amendment proposal with rationale, expected impact, and affected teams.
2. **Review Window** — Open a fixed review period for comments and objections.
3. **Steward Evaluation** — Governance stewards assess compatibility with existing articles.
4. **Ratification** — Approve via defined quorum or delegated authority.
5. **Publication** — Update canonical docs and communicate effective date.
6. **Adoption Review** — Verify implementation after an agreed evaluation interval.

## Practical Usage
- Link policy decisions to relevant articles in planning and review artifacts.
- Treat constitutional conflicts as first-class blockers, not downstream cleanup.
- Use amendments to resolve recurring friction instead of creating informal exceptions.
