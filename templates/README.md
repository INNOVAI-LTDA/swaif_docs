# SWAIF Templates

This folder contains reusable templates for building SWAIF-aligned artifacts. Use the template that matches the stage and granularity of your work.

## When to use each template

- **`swaif-constitution.md`**
  - Use when creating or revising a project-level constitution.
  - Best for governance setup, decision rights, and non-negotiable principles.
  - Owner: program governance lead, staff architect, or principal engineer.

- **`swaif-spec-template.md`**
  - Use at initiative kickoff to define a scoped specification.
  - Best for solution intent, constitutional compliance, NFRs, risk, and approvals.
  - Owner: feature/spec author with reviewer sign-off.

- **`swaif-plan-template.md`**
  - Use after a spec is approved and before implementation begins.
  - Best for phase gates, architecture/data/API plans, observability, and security execution details.
  - Owner: implementation lead (engineering manager or tech lead).

- **`swaif-tasks-template.md`**
  - Use once plan details are stable and work is ready to be scheduled.
  - Best for executable task breakdowns, dependency mapping, and traceability to plan/spec items.
  - Owner: delivery lead and individual implementers.

## Suggested flow

1. Start with **constitution** (or validate existing one).
2. Create a **spec** aligned with constitutional requirements.
3. Build an execution **plan** with explicit stage gates.
4. Generate **tasks** mapped to plan work packages and controls.
